description: "This project is a 4x4 motion grid animation and was designed and animated as my first Motion Design project at Devine, Howest. Each tile has a unique animation, yet together they form one cohesive animated composition. The goal was to explore the software and think about rhythm, visual harmony, timing & transitions."
