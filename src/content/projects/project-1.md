description: "This website was my integration project at Devine, Howest, combining skills learned during the semester. It features a bright, interactive entrance animation and focuses on helping students save money with tips and engaging elements. I also used light and shadows creatively to enhance the visual experience. For my first real project with just half a year of experience, I’m proud of what I accomplished."
