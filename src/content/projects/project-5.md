For this school project, we worked with Telenet as our client and explored the challenge of responsive design. The goal was to figure out how layouts, structures, and content placement shift across a prototype with different screen sizes, while still staying clear, usable, and visually consistent. The result is a flexible, well-thought-out design system that adapts smoothly from mobile to desktop without losing its flow, made in Figma.
